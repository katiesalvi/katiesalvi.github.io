Originally, I had illustrated a smaller figure to represent myself under the centipede, wielding a sword, but after working with the image for so long, I had become accustomed to the figure of the centipede and was no longer as afraid of it.">

This year, she transferred to a new school, and was very nervous about the experience, saying she was afraid she would not make friends, and she would miss her cats very much. Knowing that she's a fan of printed and patterned t-shirts, I decided that this was the best gift I could make for her, showing her that I am still here to support her and talk to her when she feels lonely at her new school, and to remind her of her kitties.">
